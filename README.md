# Traffic_Analysis
Overview

This repository contains the code and analysis for a project focused on the analysis of traffic congestion. The project utilizes a dataset with information about traffic congestion at different junctions, including DateTime, Junction, Vehicles, and ID.

Dashboard

The project includes a dashboard that provides the following analyses:

Sum of Junctions by Vehicles:

Visualizes the total number of vehicles at each junction. Count of ID:

Displays the total count of unique IDs in the dataset. Count of ID by Years of Junction:

Breaks down the count of unique IDs by the years of junction. Sum of Junction by Vehicles ID:

Shows the sum of vehicles at each junction grouped by unique IDs. Code Structure

The project is organized as follows:

data/: Contains the dataset used for analysis (your_dataset.csv). analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis and visualization. dashboard/: Includes files related to the dashboard, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. README.md: This file providing an overview of the project. Usage
